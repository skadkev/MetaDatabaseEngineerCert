Applied Learning Project

You’ll complete a series of 5 projects in which you will demonstrate your proficiency in different aspects of database engineering. 

You’ll demonstrate your skills with database normalization by structuring your own relational database by defining relationships between entities and developing relational schema. 

This is followed by a stored procedure project in which you’ll demonstrate your competency in SQL automation by writing a stored procedure to solve real world problems. After developing your skills in Python, you’ll create a Python application to administer a MySQL database and program its interactions with clients. 

In the next project, you are required to apply data modeling to a real-world project by enacting advanced data modeling concepts such as automation, storage and optimization. 

Finally, you’ll be tasked with creating a MySQL database solution for an app by drawing on the knowledge and skills that they have gained throughout the program.
